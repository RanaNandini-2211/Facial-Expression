Facial Emotion Recognition with Real-Time Detection: This project uses a CNN-based deep learning model to recognize facial emotions in real-time. It employs OpenCV for face detection via webcam and classifies emotions into seven categories: Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprised, using a labeled dataset of grayscaleÂ images.
